    <h1>Hellow Sam</h1>
<p>For <b>Gujarat Titans</b>, this was a <em>wonderful chance</em> that has gone abegging to confirm a spot in the final two, and they will now have to wait for the outcome of the RCB and LSG, assuming PBKS-MI is not rained out.
They would also be worried that they are stumbling at the business end of the tournament, now having lost two in a row. And they will be even more worried that one of the successful top 3 trio, Jos Buttler not being available for the playoffs.
The day began with CSK winning the toss and choosing to bat first. <strong>Ayush Mhatre</strong> continued his rich vein of form, scoring a brisk <mark>34 off just 17 balls</mark>, 28<sup>th</sup><sub>postion</sub> <del>which were scored off a single Arshad Khan over.</del> 
<br><hr> Patel and Devon Conway continued where he left off.
 <i>Devon Conway</i> <u>getting to a well-made half century</u>, while Urvil too looked good while he was striking.
